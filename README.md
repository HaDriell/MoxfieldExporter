# MoxfieldExporter

Hello there !
This is just a casual command line tool hacked together in C/C++ in half a day. 
I'm currently using Cockatrice a lot to play MTG online. 
I don't want to synchronize constantly both local & online decks and I prefer
using Moxfield/Scryfall for deckbuilding. So I end up exporting a lot from Moxfield
to Cockatrice and it's tedious. With this tool I can download my entire deck collection 
in one command line.
